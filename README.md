# FuzzySpell

FuzzySpell is a custom-built, high-performance spell checker and suggestion engine written in pure Python. It implements core fuzzy matching algorithms and data structures from scratch—Levenshtein Distance, Jaro-Winkler, Soundex, and a trie-based dictionary—for typo detection and context-aware correction ranking.
